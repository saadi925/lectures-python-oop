Lecture 8: Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are recurring solutions to common problems in software design. They provide templates and guidelines for structuring code to solve specific types of problems. Design patterns help in creating more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software.

Here's a brief overview of some common design patterns:

Singleton Pattern: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

Factory Method Pattern: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Decorator Pattern: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

Adapter Pattern: Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

Facade Pattern: Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a high-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Composite Pattern: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

These are just a few of the many design patterns available. Understanding and using design patterns can significantly improve the quality and maintainability of your code.
