## Introduction to OOP

This section provides an overview of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its fundamental concepts.

## Lecture 1: Classes and Objects

Learn about classes and objects, the building blocks of object-oriented programming.

## Lecture 2: Inheritance

Understand the concept of inheritance and how it facilitates code reuse and organization.

## Lecture 3: Encapsulation

Explore the importance of encapsulation in OOP and how it helps control access to data and behavior.

## Lecture 4: Polymorphism

Learn about polymorphism, which allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common base type.

## Lecture 5: Abstraction

Discover the concept of abstraction and how it simplifies complex systems.

## Lecture 6: Composition

Understand composition as a way to build complex objects by combining simpler ones.

## Lecture 7: Aggregation

Learn about aggregation, which represents relationships between whole-part objects.

## Lecture 8: Association

Explore associations between objects and how they relate to each other.

## Lecture 9: Singleton Pattern

Learn about the Singleton Pattern, which ensures a class has only one instance.

## Lecture 10: Factory Method Pattern

Discover the Factory Method Pattern, a creational pattern that defines an interface for creating objects.
